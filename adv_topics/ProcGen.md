# Procedural Generation Advanced Topic Presentations

Before your presentation, use this file to get your talk outline approved. Be
sure to provide an estimated time to spend on teach topic (totalling 45 minutes)
and be sure not to repeat any topics covered in previous presentations.

## Presentation 1
### Pixel Stellar

- Topic 1: What is Noise? (05 minutes):
  - Different types of noise (white noise,  rigid fractal noise, cellular automata, etc.)
    - Perlin Noise as the main topic of the presentation.
  - Brief discussion on how pure randomness is different from perlin noise
- Topic 2: Perlin Noise (05 minutes):
  - Original function written by Ken Perlin
    - Brief information on Ken Perlin as a computer scientist
  - Created in 1983 for the CGI film *Tron (1982)*
  - Improvement to the algorithm in 2002
- Topic 3: Why Perlin Noise? (10 minutes):
  - In-depth comparison to pure randomness
    - White Noise is too rough for video games
    - Perlin Noise creates smooth transitions between random values (better for video games)
  - Spatial Coherence (smooth transitions)
    - Essential for natural looking generation in video games
  - Applications in video games
    - Terraria world generation
    - Minecraft world generation
    - (Possible) other world generation
- Topic 4: The Algorithm (25 minutes):
  - 1D generation
  - Start with array of randomly generated numbers
    - These can be viewed as the slope of a linear equation
  - Linear interpolation can be used to generate values between the slopes
    - This creates what looks like a smoother line of a function
  - Smooth step function can be used to further smooth the transition near the slopes
  - Octaves can be added to create more variation to the smooth curve
  - Extension into 2D
    - Grid of unit (directional) vectors instead of slopes
